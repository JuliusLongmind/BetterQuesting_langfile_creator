# BetterQuesting langfile creator for Seablock Rustic Water
Little tool to localize BetterQuesting quest book

By calling ./lang_creator.py -l <lang> you can generate an en_US.lang file, and an empty .lang file for locaizing quests to your language and modify the DefaultQuests.json from ~/.minecraft/config/betterquesting dir.

The generated .lang files should be placed into ~/.minecraft/resources/betterquesting/lang.

The DefaultQuests.json from ~/.minecraft/config/betterquesting sould be replaced with the generated DefaultQuests.json_new.
